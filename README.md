- 👋 Hi, I’m @majikula
- 👀 I’m interested in fishing (not Phishing) and learning code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to learn code without paying for it
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone that is a self educated Software Engineer. The struggle is real.
- 📫 How to reach me anything and everything. I'm 46 and my career as a Network Engineer (physical not logical) is dying as the Cloud becomes a storm. I am trying to to turn 20 years of designing and building data centers into a productive next 20 years until I retiire.
